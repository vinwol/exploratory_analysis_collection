# Collection of Methods for Exploratory Analysis

Comprehensive collection of R scripts for performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). 
It follows a structured approach to data understanding and preparation.
Work in progress to unify and streamline the EDA workflow.

## Key Topics Covered

- **Descriptive Summaries**: 
Generate comprehensive statistics and visualizations for continuous and categorical variables.
- **Outlier Detection**: 
Implement and visualize outliers using various statistical and robust methods.
- **Missing Data Handling**: 
Analyze missingness patterns, perform intelligent NA removal, and apply diverse imputation techniques (e.g., mice, VIM).
- **Feature Engineering**: 
Transform continuous features (log, z-score, min-max, softmax) and discretize them using various binning strategies.
- **Correlation Analysis**: 
Explore relationships between variables through heatmaps and scatterplots.
- **Feature Selection**: 
Utilize filter methods based on variance, MAD, entropy, mutual information, correlation, and Laplacian scores to identify relevant features.
- **Influence Analysis & Dimensionality Reduction**: 
Apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Independent Component Analysis (ICA), and Factor Analysis for deeper insights and dimensionality reduction, including specialized methods for mixed data types.
